I'm codebreaker, trying to guess your pattern, in both order and color. After each of my guesses, you'll be prompted to give my guess a number of black pegs and white pegs. 

The number of black pegs you give my guess represents the number of code pegs from my guess are correct in both color and position. 

The number of white pegs you give my guess represents the number of code pegs that are correct in color, but in the wrong position. 

If there are duplicate colors in my guess, they can't all be awarded a black/white peg unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate colors in your secret code. For example, if your hidden code is ('a', 'a', 'b', 'b') and I guess ('a', 'a', 'a', 'b'), you should respond with:
    * a black peg for the first 'a'
    * another black peg for the second 'a'
    * nothing for the third 'a', since there isn't a third 'a' in your code
    * another black peg for the last 'b' 
    * nothing to indicate your code has a second black
