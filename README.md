## Description
**mastermind** is a package designed to make it easy to emulate the [MasterMind Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) in Python code. It also includes a functioning implementation of MasterMind! This lets you play games against your computer or even have your computer play itself. See "WHEREVER I DISCUESS MAIN.PY" for more info on the implementation.
## Installation
```zsh
pip install mastermind
```
### Requirements
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), used by the _SelfGame_ object
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm), used to display progress bars when finding next guess. _Note: only some algorithms support progress bars. See "WHEREVER I DISCUSS ALGORITHMS"_
## Usage
